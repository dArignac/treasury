=== Firebase setup
* go to the Firebase console https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ and create a new project
* enable and configure authentication (treasury is developed with Google auth only - but you shouldn't care)
* in database enable Cloud Firestore

==== Firestore rules
You have to configre the Firestore rules like so:

[source, json]
-------------------
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if true;

      match /movies/{anyDocument} {
        allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
        allow read: if true;
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------

==== Firebase hosting
If you like to host the app on Firebase, do the following:

* build production version with `ng build -prod`
* initialize firebase with `firebase init` (only needed once)
* deploy it with `firebase deploy`
* that's it!
