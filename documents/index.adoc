WARNING: Currently in development - do not consider this stable!

== Purpose and Golden Goal
This tool shall help you keeping track of your physical movie collection. +
If you share movies with your friends like I do, this tool will help you.

== Hint regarding release timeline
There is *no time line* and no real plan. I work on this project whenever I'm in the mood and have the time.

*It's done, when it's done.*

However, if you like to contribute, please get in touch through https://github.com/dArignac/treasury/issues[Github's issue section]. Additionally I usually track bigger changes as https://github.com/dArignac/treasury/projects[Github Project], check it to see what's going on.

== Functionality limitations
* search will only use movies/series found in themoviedb.org
* manual addition of items not found in this api is not supported
