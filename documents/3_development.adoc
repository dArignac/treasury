== Development
There is *no time line* and no real plan. I work on this project whenever I'm in the mood and have the time.

*It's done, when it's done.*

However, if you like to contribute, please get in touch through https://github.com/dArignac/treasury/issues[Github's issue section]. Additionally I usually track bigger changes as https://github.com/dArignac/treasury/projects[Github Project], check it to see what's going on.

=== Workflows
* use `ng update` to update Angular stuff
* use `ng generate component --project=treasury` to create a new component
* use `npm outdated` to find outdated packages
* use `make update-data-privacy` from the root directory to update the HTML of the `DataPrivacyComponent` from the contents of `DATA-PRIVACY.md`
