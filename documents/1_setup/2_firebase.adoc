=== Firebase setup
* go to the Firebase console https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ and create a new project
* enable and configure authentication (treasury is developed with Google auth only - but you shouldn't care)
* in database enable Cloud Firestore
* enable Functions

==== Update environment values
Grab the Firebase settings for Web and update `treasury/src/environments/environment.dev.ts` with it:

[source,typescript]
-------------------
// NOTE other environment settings are stripped
export const environment = {
  firebase: {
    apiKey: '',
    authDomain: '',
    databaseURL: '',
    projectId: '',
    storageBucket: '',
    messagingSenderId: ''
  }
};
-------------------

==== Setup local enviroment
First, install firebase and firebase-tools globally (if not yet done):

[source]
--------
npm install -g firebase-tools firebase firebase-functions@latest firebase-admin@latest
--------

Go to the project's root folder (containing the folders `treasury`, `documents` and `functions`)
Then initialize firebase with `firebase init`.
You should select `Firestore` and `Functions`. If you want to host also select `Hosting`.

The `firebase.json` of the treasury project is already set up, after your setup steps the file shouldn't have changed. The setup will create an additional `.firebaserc` file that will contain your Firebase project name identifier.
