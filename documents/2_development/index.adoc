== Development
There is no time line and no real plan. I work on this project whenever I'm in the mood and have the time. It's done, when it's done.
However, if you like to contribute, please get in touch through Github's issue section.

=== Workflows
* use `ng update` to update Angular stuff
* use `npm outdated` to find outdated packages
* use `make update-data-privacy` from the root directory to update the HTML of the `DataPrivacyComponent` from the contents of `DATA-PRIVACY.md`
